Portal flow
****************************

This integration pattern is suitable for senders who want to create :ref:`a signature job in portal flow <signering-i-portalflyt>`. The signer logs in to the signing portal, signs the document, and the sender will then be able to poll for a status and retrieve the signed document. This scenario is designed to support a flow where it is necessary to obtain signatures from more than one signer.

To ease the integration, we provide C# and Java libraries. If you are creating your own client, you will have to interact directly with the API. The message format of the API is XML, and relevant types can be found in `portal.xsd <https://github.com/digipost/signature-api-specification/blob/master/schema/xsd/portal.xsd>`_.

|portalflytskjema|
 **Flow chart for signing in portal flow:** *The chart shows that a sender creates a signature job, starts polling, signers signing the job, a status update is fetched by polling by the sender, followed by downloading the signed document. If you send only one job to one signer, please disregard the first "steg 4"-section. Solid lines show user flow and dashed lines shows requests to and responses from the API.*

            PortalJobResponse portalJobResponse = client.create(portalJob);

    ..  group-tab:: HTTP

        The flow starts when the sender sends a request to create the signature job to the API. This request is a `multipart message <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Multipart_messages>`_ comprised of a document bundle part and a metadata part.

        - The request is a ``HTTP POST`` to the resource ``<rot-URL>/portal/signature-jobs``.
        - The document bundle is added to the multipart message with ``application/octet-stream`` as media type. See :ref:`informasjonOmDokumentpakken` for more information on the document bundle.
        - The metadata in the multipart request is defined by the ``portal-signature-job-request`` element. These are added with media type ``application/xml``.

        The following example shows metadata for a signature job in a portal flow:

        ..  code-block:: xml

            <portal-signature-job-request xmlns="http://signering.posten.no/schema/v1">

            </portal-signature-job-request>

..  NOTE::
    You may identify the signature jobâ€™s signers by personal identification number :code:`IdentifiedByPersonalIdentificationNumber` or contact information. When identifying by contact information, you may choose between instantiating a :code:`PortalSigner` using :code:`IdentifiedByEmail`, :code:`IdentifiedByMobileNumber` or :code:`IdentifiedByEmailAndMobileNumber`.

                A sender can choose if the signer is signing on behalf of himself or by virtue of a role. This is done by setting the attribute ``on-behalf-of`` to ``SELF`` or ``OTHER``.

                The signed document will not be sent to the signers digital mailbox if signing on behalf of someone else. For public organizations, you must address the signer by a chosen phone number and e-mail, as Kontakt- og Reservasjonsregisteret will not be used.

                ..  NOTE::

                    The element ``notifications-using-lookup`` is only available for public organizations. As this will look up the signers *private* contact information, it is not possible at the same time to indicate that the person signing on behalf of someone else. Thus, you cannot set ``on-behalf-of`` to ``OTHER`` if you want to use the Kontakt- og Reservasjonsregisteret to address signers.

Other settings
---------------------------

Order
^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``order`` attribute on ``signer`` is used to specify the order of the signers. In the example above, the signature job will only be available to the signers with ``order = "1"``. Once signed, the job becomes available to those with ``order = "2"``, and for the signer with ``order = "3"`` when those with ``order = "2"`` have signed.

Availability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The element ``availability`` is used to control the period of time a signature job is available to the signer(s).

..  code-block:: xml

    <availability>
        <activation-time>2016-02-10T12:00:00+01:00</activation-time>
        <available-seconds>864000</available-seconds>
    </availability>

The time specified in ``activation-time`` indicates when the job is activated, and the first signers are given the opportunity to sign the job. The duration specified in ``available-seconds`` applies to all signers. That is, all signers will have the same time to sign or reject the job from it becomes available to them. Thus, this period applies to each set of signers with the same ``order``.

**For example, enter 345600 seconds (4 days) for signers with an order:**

#. Signers with ``order = 1`` get 4 days from `` activation-time`` to sign.
#. Signers with ``order = 2`` will have the document made available *immediately* when all signers with ``order = 1`` have signed. They will then have 4 days from the time signature job is made available.

..  NOTE::
    If you omit ``availability``, the job will be activated immediately, and the job will be available for a maximum of 30 days for each set of ``order`` grouped signers.

..  IMPORTANT::
    A signature job expires and stops if at least one signer does not sign within their time period when the job is available.

..  IMPORTANT::
    Jobs that specify greater ``available-seconds`` than 7,776,000 seconds (90 days) are rejected.

Identifier in the signed document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The element ``identifier-in-signed-documents`` is used to specify how signers are to be identified in the signed documents. Allowed values are ``PERSONAL_IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER_AND_NAME``, ``DATE_OF_BIRTH_AND_NAME`` and ``NAME``, but not all are valid for all types of signature jobs and senders. For more information, see :ref:`identifisereUndertegnere`.


You can specify a  signature type and required authentication level. If signature type or required authentication level is omitted, default values as specified by the `functional documentation <http://digipost.github.io/signature-api-specification/v1.0/#signaturtype>`_ will apply:

..  tabs::

    ..  code-tab:: c#

        Document documentToSign = null; //As initialized earlier
        var signers = new List<Signer>
        {
            new Signer(new PersonalIdentificationNumber("00000000000"), new NotificationsUsingLookup())
            {
                SignatureType = SignatureType.AdvancedSignature
            }
        };

        var job = new Job(documentToSign, signers, "myReferenceToJob")
        {
            AuthenticationLevel = AuthenticationLevel.Four
        };

..  NOTE::
    Note that only public organizations can do :code:`NotificationsUsingLookup`.

Step 2: Get status changes
============================

To find out what the status of the signature jobs you have created, you must periodically send requests to the signature service (polling). As a sender, you need to check to which job the update applies to, update the status in your system and then confirm it.

The response to this call will be one of two things:

- **status update:** a ``200 OK`` response that contains information about new status for one job. This is defined by the element ``portal-signature-job-status-change-response``.
- **no update available:** If there are no updates to your signature jobs, you will receive a ``204 No Content`` response.

..  NOTE:: The next allowed polling time will be 10 minutes in the production environment if the queue is empty, while for test environments it will be between 5 and 30 seconds. In practice, the time for the next permitted polling request will be immediate as long as one receives a response that includes a status update.

The following example shows how this can be handled and examples of data to extract from a change response.

..  NOTE::
    Status updates you download will disappear from the queue. This allows you to ask for status updates in parallel, and you will not receive the same status update twice. It is therefore important that you confirm receipt of each status update as soon as possible, because if an error still occurs during transmission or processing, the receipt will be queued again after 10 minutes.

Responses will always include the next permitted poll time, which tells you when you can make the next request, and it is important that this time is met. If you send a request before this time has passed, you will receive a ``429 Too Many Requests`` response. This will also contain a next permitted poll time, containing a new time.

..  tabs::

        ..  code-block:: c#

            PortalClient portalClient = null; //As initialized earlier

            // system, only poll a few times a day.
            var change = await portalClient.GetStatusChange();

            switch (change.Status)
            {
                case JobStatus.NoChanges:
                    //Queue is empty. Additional polling will result in blocking for a defined period.
                    break;

                case JobStatus.InProgress:

            if (pollingWillResultInBlock)
            {
                //Wait until next permitted poll time has passed before polling again.
            }

            //Confirm the receipt to remove it from the queue
            await portalClient.Confirm(change.ConfirmationReference);

            PortalClient client = null; // As initialized earlier

            PortalJobStatusChanged statusChange = client.getStatusChange();

            if (statusChange.is(PortalJobStatus.NO_CHANGES)) {
                // Queue is empty. Must wait before polling again
                Instant nextPermittedPollTime = statusChange.getNextPermittedPollTime();
            } else {
                // Received status update, act according to status
                PortalJobStatus signatureJobStatus = statusChange.getStatus();
                Instant nextPermittedPollTime = statusChange.getNextPermittedPollTime();
            }

            //Get status for signer
            Signature signature = statusChange.getSignatureFrom(
                    SignerIdentifier.identifiedByPersonalIdentificationNumber("12345678910")
            );

            //Confirm the receipt to remove it from the queue
            client.confirm(statusChange);

    ..  group-tab:: HTTP

        To poll, you do a ``HTTP GET`` against ``<root-URL>/portal/ signature-jobs``. Signature jobs that are not placed on a specific queue will be placed in a standard queue. If the job is placed on a specific queue, then the query parameter ``polling_queue`` must also be set to the name of the queue, e.g. ``<root-URL>/portal/signature-jobs? polling_queue=custom-queue``. You should not include any request body on this call.

        The following is an example of a response where part of the signature job has been completed:

        ..  code-block:: xml

            <portal-signature-job-status-change-response xmlns="http://signering.posten.no/schema/v1">
               <signature-job-id>1</signature-job-id>
               <status>IN_PROGRESS</status>
               <confirmation-url>https://api.signering.posten.no/api/{sender-identifier}/portal/signature-jobs/1/complete</confirmation-url>
               <signatures>
                   <signature>
                       <status since="2017-01-23T12:51:43+01:00">SIGNED</status>
                       <personal-identification-number>12345678910</personal-identification-number>
                       <xades-url>https://api.signering.posten.no/api/{sender-identifier}/portal/signature-jobs/1/xades/1</xades-url>
                   </signature>
                   <signature>
                       <status since="2017-01-23T12:00:00+01:00">WAITING</status>
                       <personal-identification-number>98765432100</personal-identification-number>
                   </signature>
                   <pades-url>https://api.signering.posten.no/api/{sender-identifier}/portal/signature-jobs/1/pades</pades-url>
               </signatures>
            </portal-signature-job-status-change-response>

        The ``X-Next-permitted-poll-time`` header will give the next permitted poll time in each response.

        Finally, make a ``HTTP POST`` request to the ``confirmation-url`` to confirm that you have successfully retrieved the status change. If it is the last update and the job is completed successfully and :ref:`langtidslagring` is used, this will mark the assignment as completed and stored. Otherwise, the assignment will be deleted from the signing portal.


Step 3: Get signed documents
==============================

When getting XAdES and PAdES for a PortalJob, remember that the XAdES is per signer, while there is only one PAdES.

..  tabs::

    .. group-tab:: C#

        ..  code-block:: c#

            PortalClient portalClient = null; //As initialized earlier
            var jobStatusChanged = await portalClient.GetStatusChange();

            //Get XAdES:
            var xades = await portalClient.GetXades(jobStatusChanged.Signatures.ElementAt(0).XadesReference);

            //Get PAdES:
            var pades = await portalClient.GetPades(jobStatusChanged.PadesReference);

    .. group-tab:: Java

        ..  code-block:: java

            PortalClient client = null; // As initialized earlier
            PortalJobStatusChanged statusChange = null; // As returned when polling for status changes

            // Retrieve PAdES:
            if (statusChange.isPAdESAvailable()) {
                InputStream pAdESStream = client.getPAdES(statusChange.getpAdESUrl());
            }

            // Retrieve XAdES for all signers:
            for (Signature signature : statusChange.getSignatures()) {
                if (signature.is(SignatureStatus.SIGNED)) {
                    InputStream xAdESStream = client.getXAdES(signature.getxAdESUrl());
                }
            }

            // â€¦ or for one specific signer:
            Signature signature = statusChange.getSignatureFrom(
                    SignerIdentifier.identifiedByPersonalIdentificationNumber("12345678910"));
            if (signature.is(SignatureStatus.SIGNED)) {
                InputStream xAdESStream = client.getXAdES(signature.getxAdESUrl());
            }

    ..  group-tab:: HTTP

        The response in the previous step contains the links ``xades-url`` and ``pades-url``. These you can do a ``HTTP GET`` on to download the signed document in the two formats. For more information on the format of the signed document, see :ref:`signerte-dokumenter`.

        You download the XAdES file per signer, while the PAdES file is downloaded across all signers. This will include signing information for all signers who have so far signed the job. In most cases, it is not necessary to download the PAdES until all signers have the status ``SIGNED``.

Specifying queues
===================

Specifies the queue that jobs and status changes for a signature job will occur in for signature jobs where :code:`StatusRetrievalMethod == POLLING`. This is a feature aimed at organizations where it makes sense to retrieve status changes from several queues. This may be if the organization has more than one division, and each division has an application that create signature jobs through the API and want to retrieve status changes independent of the other divisionâ€™s actions.

To specify a queue, set :code:`Sender` :code:`pollingQueue` through when constructing a sender. Please note that the same sender must be specified when polling to retrieve status changes. The :code:`Sender` can be set globally in :code:`ClientConfiguration` or on every job.

..  tabs::

    ..  group-tab:: C#

        ..  code-block:: c#

            PortalClient portalClient = null; //As initialized earlier

            var organizationNumber = "123456789";
            var sender = new Sender(organizationNumber, new PollingQueue("CustomPollingQueue"));

            var documentToSign = new Document(
                "Subject of Message",
                "This is the content",
                FileType.Pdf,

            );

            var signers = new List<Signer>
            {
                new Signer(new PersonalIdentificationNumber("00000000000"), new NotificationsUsingLookup())
            };

            var portalJob = new Job(documentToSign, signers, "myReferenceToJob", sender);

            var portalJobResponse = await portalClient.Create(portalJob);

            var changedJob = await portalClient.GetStatusChange(sender);

    ..  group-tab:: Java

        ..  code-block:: java

            ClientConfiguration clientConfiguration = null; // As initialized earlier
            PortalClient client = new PortalClient(clientConfiguration);

            Sender sender = new Sender("000000000", PollingQueue.of("CustomPollingQueue"));

            byte[] documentBytes = null; // Loaded document bytes
            PortalDocument document = PortalDocument.builder("Subject", "document.pdf", documentBytes).build();

            PortalJob portalJob = PortalJob.builder(
                    document,
                    PortalSigner.identifiedByPersonalIdentificationNumber("12345678910",
                            NotificationsUsingLookup.EMAIL_ONLY).build(),
                    PortalSigner.identifiedByPersonalIdentificationNumber("12345678911",
                            Notifications.builder().withEmailTo("email@example.com").build()).build(),
                    PortalSigner.identifiedByEmail("email@example.com").build()
            ).withSender(sender).build();

            PortalJobResponse portalJobResponse = client.create(portalJob);

            PortalJobStatusChanged statusChange = client.getStatusChange(sender);

        This functionality exists with integration via HTTP, but the example has not been generated yet.

Delete documents
==================

After receiving a status change, the documents can be deleted as follows:

        ..  code-block:: java

        PortalClient client = null; // As initialized earlier
        PortalJobStatusChanged statusChange = null; // As returned when polling for status changes

        client.deleteDocuments(statusChange.getDeleteDocumentsUrl());
